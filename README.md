# Allen & Roseveare Grocers
106 Throckmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

In 1890, a large land auction held by the Tamalpais Land and Water Company set the stage for Mill Valley’s early beginnings. The first lot sold at that auction was the one at the intersection of Bernard and Throckmorton Avenues, currently known as 106 Throckmorton Avenue. "It was leased as the site of a carpenter shop which was replaced by 1894 with a two-story building crowned with a cupola that became Wheeler Martin's Pioneer Grocery. Martin was appointed postmaster in 1894 and the post office was moved to his store from the railroad station."

In 1910 Allen & Roseveare, Quality Grocers took over this site. Three more grocery stores followed, the last being Safeway in 1930. When Safeway moved locations in 1939, the site became Osgood’s Tavern, beginning the long line of food and liquor purveyors at this location, including The Old Mill Tavern, O’Leary’s, Bistro Bistro, Annabell’s, The Frog and The Peach, and the current occupant, Vasco.
